# Cypress Project E-commerce testing

This is an project which I have done to learn Cypress testing framework. The goal of the project was to automate [Sauce Demo website](https://saucedemo.com).Tests are written using Cypress version 13.6.3.There are both positive and negative test cases. Main browser used for running tests was Google Chrome version 120.Tests also work on Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers.

You can install all of the dependencies using command in the terminal **npm install**. To run the Cypress, just use the command **npx cypress open**. All of the scripts for running tests are in the **package.json** file. Also, you can create reports by using npm commands, which are provided in the **package.json** file.
